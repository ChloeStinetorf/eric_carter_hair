							&ldquo;Eric completely transformed my dry frizzy hair into beautiful shiny hair...He is amazing with my highlights, they always come out so sun-kissed. My hair has never looked better!&rdquo;<br />

							</p>
							<p>
							&ldquo;Eric is the BEST stylist/colorist I have ever been to...I refer everyone I know to him because he loves what he does and it shows in how he works on you.&rdquo;<br />

							</p>
							<p>
							&ldquo;I looked exactly as I had wanted to for my wedding day, thanks to Eric. He is simply the best&mdash;both professionally, and talent-wise.&rdquo;<br />

							</p>
							<p>
							&ldquo;I've always gone to Eric for my color because he's great with blondes. One day I stopped in for a quick blow out before an event and he offered to do my make-up as well. The photos of my event were amazing! I'm so glad I've got Eric to rely on.&rdquo;<br />

							</p>
							<p>
							&ldquo;I had kept the same style forever and was in desperate need of something new...I just gave him a basic idea of a look that I wanted to go for, and he took it, adapted it just a bit to suit me, and the results were amazing.&rdquo;<br />

							</p>
							<p>
							&ldquo;Eric is really awesome with guys cuts. I've had my hair short and longer and Eric has helped me transition looks and give me an &ldquo;edge&rdquo;. He knows how to bring out face shape and is a good collaborator when I have ideas about what I 	want.&rdquo;<br />

							&ldquo;Would it be wrong to admit I've been obsessed with my mirror since leaving Eric's chair yesterday?&rdquo;<br />

							</p>
							<p>
							&ldquo;Eric is great at developing a real rapport with his clients. At no time during my appointment do I feel rushed or hurried; also, he's a cutie & a sweetie which is also greatly appreciated!!&rdquo;<br />

							</p>
							<p>
							&ldquo;Not only is Eric an all around lovely person, he is great at carrying out your vision or giving you a cut/color when you have no clue what you want.  He truly cares about his clients and will make sure you love it before he rests. I couldn't be happier with the services I received. Thanks Eric!!&rdquo;<br />

							&ldquo;It's been over two months since Eric cut and colored my hair. I have really curly hair and have gone to curly hair cutters for over 10 years and have appreciated how they have treated my hair but I was looking for a change. More style, maybe taking a chance on layering. I love my hair, I am amazed how it still looks great and how the color (through a tropical vacation spent primarily in the ocean) is holding. The highlights he gave me were exactly what I was looking for - camouflaging the grey and slowing the demarcation line of incoming hair. My hair grows fast so it can be pricey keeping up with color, and I feel like I could go at least another month before I went in for a touch up. The cut has grown out beautifully - loved it from the start, but love it even more now. I didn't have to go into long explanations of what I wanted and felt Eric heard me the first time and gave me exactly what I asked for which is an anomaly as far as I'm concerned.&rdquo;<br />
